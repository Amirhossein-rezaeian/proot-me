and <tt>binfmt_misc</tt>.  This means that users don't need any privilege
or setup to do things like: using an arbitrary directory as the new
root file-system or making files accessible somewhere else in the
file-system hierarchy or executing programs built for another CPU
architecture transparently through QEMU user-mode.  Technically PRoot
relies on <tt>ptrace</tt>, an unprivileged system-call available in every
Linux kernel.</p><p>The new root file-system, a.k.a <em>guest rootfs</em>, typically contains a
Linux distribution.  By default PRoot confines the execution of
programs to the guest rootfs only, however users can use the built-in
<em>mount/bind</em> mechanism to access files and directories from the actual
root file-system, a.k.a <em>host rootfs</em>, just as if they were part of
the guest rootfs.</p><p>When the guest Linux distribution is made for a CPU architecture
incompatible with the host one, PRoot uses the CPU emulator QEMU
user-mode to execute transparently guest programs.  It's a convenient
way to develop, to build, and to validate any guest Linux packages
seamlessly on users' computer, just as if they were in a <em>native</em>
guest environment.  That way all of the cross-compilation issues are
avoided.</p><p>PRoot can also <em>mix</em> the execution of host programs and the execution
of guest programs emulated by QEMU user-mode.  This is useful to use
host equivalents of programs that are missing from the guest rootfs
and to speed up build-time by using cross-compilation tools or
CPU-independent programs, like interpreters.</p><p>It is worth noting that the guest kernel is never involved, regardless
of whether QEMU user-mode is used or not.  Technically, when guest
programs perform access to system resources, PRoot translates their
requests before sending them to the host kernel.  This means that
guest programs can use host resources (devices, network, ...) just as
if they were "normal" host programs.</p></div><div xmlns="" class="section" id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2><p>In the following examples the directories <tt>/mnt/slackware-8.0</tt> and
<tt>/mnt/armslack-12.2/</tt> contain a Linux distribution respectively made
for x86 CPUs and ARM CPUs.</p><div class="section" id="chroot\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> equivalent</h3><p>To execute a command inside a given Linux distribution, just give
<tt>proot</tt> the path to the guest rootfs followed by the desired
command.  The example below executes the program <tt>cat</tt> to print the
content of a file:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ cat /etc/motd

Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0</pre><p>The default command is <tt>/bin/sh</tt> when none is specified. Thus the
shortest way to confine an interactive shell and all its sub-programs
is:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0</pre></div><div class="section" id="mount\ --bind\ equivalent"><h3><tt>mount --bind</tt> equivalent</h3><p>The default rootfs is <tt>/</tt> when none is specified, this permits to
use the bind mechanism to relocate host files and directories.  This
is typically useful to cheat programs that perform access to
hard-coded locations, like some installation scripts:</p><pre>proot -b /tmp/alternate_opt:/opt

$ cd to/sources
$ make install
[...]
install -m 755 prog "/opt/bin"
[...] # prog is installed in "/tmp/alternate_opt/bin" actually</pre><p>As shown in this example, it is possible to bind over files not even
owned by the user.  This can be used to <em>overlay</em> system configuration
files, for instance the DNS setting:</p><pre>ls -l /etc/hosts
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 675 Mar  4  2011 /etc/hosts</pre><pre>proot -b ~/alternate_hosts:/etc/hosts

$ echo '1.2.3.4 google.com' &gt; /etc/hosts
$ resolveip google.com
IP address of google.com is 1.2.3.4
$ echo '5.6.7.8 google.com' &gt; /etc/hosts
$ resolveip google.com
IP address of google.com is 5.6.7.8</pre></div><div class="section" id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> equivalent</h3><p>The option <tt>-b</tt>, short for <tt>--bind</tt>, makes any file from the host
rootfs accessible in the confined environment just as if it were
initially part of the guest rootfs.  It is sometimes required to run
programs that rely on some specific files:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/

$ ps -o tty,command
Error, do this: mount -t proc none /proc</pre><p>works better with:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ -b /proc

$ ps -o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
?        -bash
?        proot -b /proc /mnt/slackware-8.0/
?        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /bin/sh
?        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /usr/bin/ps -o tty,command</pre><p>Actually there's a bunch of such specific files, that's why PRoot
provides the option <tt>-B</tt> to bind automatically a pre-defined list of
recommended paths:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/slackware-8.0/ -B

$ ps -o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
pts/6    -bash
pts/6    proot -B /mnt/slackware-8.0/
pts/6    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /bin/sh
pts/6    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /usr/bin/ps -o tty,command</pre></div><div class="section" id="chroot\ +\ mount\ --bind\ +\ binfmt_misc\ equivalent"><h3><tt>chroot</tt> + <tt>mount --bind</tt> + <tt>binfmt_misc</tt> equivalent</h3><p>PRoot uses QEMU user-mode to execute programs built for a CPU
architecture incompatible with the host one.  From users'
point-of-view, guest programs handled by QEMU user-mode are executed
transparently, that is, just like host programs.  To enable this
feature users just have to specify which instance of QEMU user-mode
they want to use with the option <tt>-q</tt> or <tt>-Q</tt> (this latter implies
<tt>-B</tt>):</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -Q qemu-arm

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to ARMedSlack Linux 12.2</pre><p>The parameter of the <tt>-q/-Q</tt> option is actually a whole QEMU
user-mode command, for instance to enable its GDB server on port
1234:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -Q "qemu-arm -g 1234" emacs</pre><p>PRoot allows to mix transparently the emulated execution of guest
programs and the native execution of host programs in the same
file-system namespace.  It's typically useful to extend the list of
available programs and to speed up build-time significantly.  This
mixed-execution feature is enabled by default when using QEMU
user-mode, and the content of the host rootfs is made accessible
through <tt>/host-rootfs</tt>:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -Q qemu-arm

$ file /bin/echo
[...] ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM [...]
$ /bin/echo 'Hello world!'
Hello world!

$ file /host-rootfs/bin/echo
[...] ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64 [...]
$ /host-rootfs/bin/echo 'Hello mixed world!'
Hello mixed world!</pre><p>Since both host and guest programs use the guest rootfs as <tt>/</tt>,
users may want to deactivate explicitly cross-filesystem support found
in most GNU cross-compilation tools.  For example with GCC configured
to cross-compile to the ARM target:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -Q qemu-arm

$ export CC=/host-rootfs/opt/cross-tools/arm-linux/bin/gcc
$ export CFLAGS="--sysroot=/"   # could be optional indeed
$ ./configure; make</pre><p>As with regular files, a host instance of a program can be bound over
its guest instance.  Here is an example where the guest binary of
<tt>make</tt> is overlaid by the host one:</p><pre>proot -r /mnt/armslack-12.2/ -Q qemu-arm -b /usr/bin/make

$ which make
/usr/bin/make
$ make --version # overlaid
GNU Make 3.82
Built for x86_64-slackware-linux-gnu</pre><p>It's worth mentioning that even when mixing the native execution of
host programs and the emulated execution of guest programs, they still
believe they are running in a native guest environment.  As a
demonstration, here is a partial output of a typical <tt>./configure</tt>
script:</p><pre>checking whether the C compiler is a cross-compiler... no</pre></div></div><div xmlns="" class="section" id="downloads"><h2>Downloads</h2><div class="section" id=""><h3>PRoot</h3><p>The latest release of PRoot is packaged on <a href="http://packages.proot.me">http://packages.proot.me</a>
